Job interview sample code.


Given a dictionary file, generate two output files named 'sequences' and 'words'.

'sequences' should contain every sequence of four letters (alpha characters only, case sensitive) that appears exactly once in the dictionary file. There should be a line break after each sequence written to the file.

'words' should contain the corresponding words which contain each unique sequence, in the same order, again one per line.
